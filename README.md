# 🧠 Text Summarizer CLI

A lightweight and efficient command-line Text Summarizer built using Hugging Face Transformers and Google's FLAN-T5 model. This tool allows users to input long-form text directly through the terminal and generate a concise, structured, and non-repetitive summary using a transformer-based language model.

## 🚀 Installation, Setup, Requirements, Usage, Model Configuration, Example, Output, Project Structure & Author

### Clone the Repository and Setup Environment

```bash
git clone https://github.com/ronitmaheshwari05/text-summarizer-cli.git
cd text-summarizer-cli

python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate

pip install -r requirements.txt
```

---

### Requirements

```
transformers>=4.37.0
torch>=2.6.0
accelerate>=0.27.0
```

---

### Usage

Run the CLI tool:

```bash
python main.py "Paste your long article text here..."
```

The program:
- Processes input text
- Applies transformer-based summarization
- Controls repetition
- Prints a clean structured summary in the terminal

---

### Model Configuration

- Model: `google/flan-t5-small`
- Pipeline: `text2text-generation`
- Beam Search (`num_beams=5`)
- Repetition Penalty
- No Repeat N-gram Blocking
- Deterministic Generation (`do_sample=False`)
- Output Length Control (`max_new_tokens`, `min_new_tokens`)

These settings ensure stable, coherent, and non-repetitive summaries.
